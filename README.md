**MEDA** is a high-performance **Hybrid System Architecture** designed to bridge the gap between doctors and patients during physical therapy. By leveraging AI-driven exercise tracking, the project combines the flexibility of Python's AI ecosystem with the memory safety and blazing speed of Rust. 🚀

## 🛠 Technical Architecture (System Stack)

The project is engineered as a multi-layered system, ensuring high stability and real-time performance:

* **🧠 Logic & AI Layer (Python):** Utilizes `MediaPipe` and `OpenCV` for real-time biomechanical analysis. It tracks human landmarks to ensure exercises are performed with the correct form.
* **⚙️ System & UI Layer (Rust):** Features an embedded Python interpreter via the `pyo3` library. The frontend is built with `Slint UI`, providing a lightweight, native desktop experience with minimal resource overhead.
* **🔒 Safety & Concurrency:** Implements Rust's `Arc`, `Mutex`, and `AtomicBool` primitives to manage the AI lifecycle and UI thread safely, preventing race conditions during high-frequency data streaming.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* **👁️ Real-Time AI Tracking:** Automated detection and counting of exercises (e.g., squats) with goal-based feedback.
* **🔗 FFI Integration:** Seamless Foreign Function Interface communication between Python's data processing and Rust's system management.
* **⚡ High Performance:** Processed at 30 FPS (approx. 33ms latency) for a lag-free user experience.
* **👨‍⚕️ Doctor Control Panel:** A dedicated management module for patient registration and graphical data analysis.

## 📦 Installation

The project has two apps:

| Folder | App | Language |
|---|---|---|
| `MEDA-D/` | Doctor control panel | Python (CustomTkinter) |
| `MEDA-H/` | Patient app with real-time exercise tracking | Rust (Slint UI + PyO3) and Python (MediaPipe) |

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CSDC-K/M.E.D.A.git
    cd M.E.D.A
    ```
2.  Run the doctor app (Windows):
    ```bash
    cd MEDA-D
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python main.py
    ```
3.  Run the patient app:
    ```bash
    cd MEDA-H
    pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy
    cargo run --release
    ```

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap & Vision

MEDA is currently in its **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** phase. I started it in summer 2025 and paused active development in January 2026 to focus on other projects. While the core AI detection is fully functional, the following architectural expansions are planned:

### ✉️ Automated Data Synchronization & Mail Integration
> **[DEVELOPER VISION]:** 💡 To ensure data integrity between the physician and the patient, I designed a **Key-Based Verification Protocol**. 
>
> **The Architecture:**
> 1. **Dynamic Key Generation:** Every exercise request sent by the doctor generates a unique, algorithmic key (e.g., `SQ15|20260101|RANDOMKEY`). 
>    - `SQ15`: Encodes the Exercise Type and Target Amount.
>    - `|20260101|`: Timestamp for session validation.
>    - `RANDOMKEY`: A unique salt to prevent replay attacks.
> 2. **Verification Engine:** The patient’s application (Rust) decodes this key upon arrival, initializing the AI model with specific parameters (e.g., 15 Squats).
> 3. **Asynchronous Reporting:** Upon completion, the system would generate a `completed-exercises.json` file. This file acts as a local ledger, which is then parsed and transmitted back to the doctor via a secure SMTP bridge, using the unique Key as the primary identifier to ensure that only verified, doctor-requested sessions are logged.
